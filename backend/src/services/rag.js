  {
    q: "what is sovereign gold bond",
    a: "Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) are government securities denominated in grams of gold. They're issued by RBI on behalf of Government of India. Each unit equals 1 gram of gold. You get 2.5% annual interest plus capital appreciation linked to gold prices. It's the smartest way to invest in gold without storage hassles.",

    keywords: ["sovereign", "gold", "bond", "sgb", "government", "security"]
  },
  {
    q: "benefits of gold bonds vs physical gold",
    a: "SGBs beat physical gold hands down. You get 2.5% annual interest (physical gives zero), no storage costs, no purity concerns, easy liquidity on exchanges after 5 years, and capital gains tax exemption if held till maturity (8 years). Plus, you can use them as collateral for loans.",
    category: "comparison",
    keywords: ["benefits", "advantages", "physical", "vs", "comparison"]
  },
  {
    q: "how to buy gold bond",
    a: "SGBs are issued in tranches throughout the year. You can buy through banks, post offices, or online platforms during issue periods. Minimum 1 gram, maximum 4kg per person annually. Price is set based on previous 3 days' average gold prices with â‚¹50/gram discount. After listing, trade on NSE/BSE.",
    category: "buying",
    keywords: ["buy", "purchase", "how", "where", "tranche", "issue"]
  },
  {
    q: "gold investment risks",
    a: "Gold has its risks - price volatility (can swing 10-20% annually), no regular income from physical gold, currency risk if global factors dominate, and opportunity cost versus equity returns. However, it's excellent portfolio diversifier and inflation hedge. I typically recommend 5-10% portfolio allocation.",
    category: "risks",
    keywords: ["risk", "volatile", "volatility", "danger", "problem"]
  },
  {
    q: "gold price factors",
    a: "Gold moves on multiple factors: USD strength (inverse relationship), inflation expectations, central bank policies, geopolitical tensions, and demand from India/China. Recent trends show gold performing well during economic uncertainty. I watch DXY, real yields, and Fed policy closely.",
    category: "market",
    keywords: ["price", "factors", "market", "trend", "analysis", "movement"]
  },
  {
    q: "gold vs equity returns",
    a: "Long-term, equity outperforms gold significantly. Last 20 years: Sensex ~12% CAGR vs Gold ~8% CAGR. But gold shines during equity crashes - 2008, 2020 examples. Smart allocation: 70-80% equity, 10-15% gold, rest debt. Gold is insurance, not growth driver.",
    category: "returns",
    keywords: ["returns", "equity", "stock", "performance", "comparison", "allocation"]
  },
  {
    q: "best time to buy gold",
    a: "I use SIP approach for gold - regular monthly investments smooth out volatility. Tactically, buy during monsoon season (July-Sep) when rural demand is low, and avoid wedding/festival seasons when premiums spike. Dollar cost averaging works best.",
    category: "timing",
    keywords: ["when", "timing", "best", "time", "season", "buy"]
  },
  {
    q: "gold etf vs gold bonds",
    a: "Both are paper gold, but SGBs win on multiple fronts: 2.5% annual interest (ETFs give none), tax efficiency (LTCG exempt on maturity), no expense ratio (ETFs charge 0.5-1%), and government backing. ETFs offer better liquidity though. For long-term, SGBs are superior.",
    category: "comparison",
    keywords: ["etf", "vs", "versus", "difference", "better", "compare"]
  },
  {
    q: "digital gold investment",
    a: "Digital gold platforms let you buy gold in small amounts, stored by custodians. Convenient but watch for high spreads (2-3%), storage fees, and GST on buyback. Good for small systematic investments, but for serious money, SGBs or ETFs are more cost-effective.",
    category: "digital",
    keywords: ["digital", "gold", "paytm", "phonepe", "small", "amount"]
  },
  {
    q: "gold import duty impact",
    a: "India imports 800+ tonnes annually. Import duty changes directly impact domestic prices. Current 15% duty keeps local prices elevated. When duty was reduced to 7.5% in 2021, gold became attractive. I always factor policy changes in investment decisions.",
    category: "policy",
    keywords: ["import", "duty", "tax", "government", "policy", "impact"]
  },
  {
    q: "portfolio allocation gold",
    a: "I recommend 8-12% gold allocation for most portfolios. Conservative investors can go up to 15%. Gold's negative correlation with equities provides excellent portfolio stability. During 2008 crisis, while Sensex fell 50%, gold rose 25%. It's portfolio insurance.",
    category: "allocation",
    keywords: ["portfolio", "allocation", "percentage", "how", "much", "invest"]
  },
  {
    q: "gold mining stocks vs gold",
    a: "Gold mining stocks are leveraged plays on gold prices but carry operational risks. When gold rises 10%, miners might rise 20-30%, but vice versa too. I prefer direct gold exposure through SGBs/ETFs over mining stocks for core allocation. Mining stocks are speculation, gold is insurance.",
